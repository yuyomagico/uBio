# uBio - 8-bit CPU architecture example

This is a simple 8-bit architecture minimal CPU for educational purposes. More detail in the Report.pdf file.

## Modules
1. ALU (Alu.v)
2. Memory (Mem2.v)
3. Cycle (Basic CPU cyclying stages)
4. uBio_full (CPU definition for cycle stages and simulation lines at the end)
5. Simulation_config.wcfg (visual config for the simulation in old Xilinx ISE Designer)
